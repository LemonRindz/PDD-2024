#Ch. 8 Arrays

#**Lists*b
#In Python, you create lists instead of arrays, which is similar to, but more
#capable than the traditonal array. A list is a an object that contains multiple
#data items. Each item stored in a list is called an element. Objects enclosed in
#brackets ([]) and separated by commas (,) are the values of the elements.
#Ex1. Here is a statement that creates a list of integers (int):
#even_numbs = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
#Ex2. Here is a statement that creates a list of strings:
#names = ['Molly', 'Steven', 'Will', 'Alicia', 'Adriana']
#You can use the 'print' function to display an entire list, as shown here:
#numbs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#print(numbs)
