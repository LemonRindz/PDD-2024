# PDD-2024
This is a compilation of chapter and lecture notes I've taken during my Spring 2024 semester at Gwinnett Tech; It's mainly focused on the Python language, but will occasionally include JavaScript and C++.
Majority of my notes will stem from 'Starting Out with Programming Logicand Design' 5th Edition by Tony Gaddis. I recommend getting the latest version of this textbook if this becomes out-dated.
